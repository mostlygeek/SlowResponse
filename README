A simple Play2.0 app that only handles timing out of requests. 

Why is this useful? 
-------------------

- for testing async libraries that need a simple way to create long
  running server connections

- accessible anywhere due to a very permissive crossdomain.xml file
  ... well to Flash/Unity/etc plugins
